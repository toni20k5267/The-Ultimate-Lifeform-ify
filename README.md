## 

This extension was originally made as a submission for Jshlatt's Shark Tank Pitch Stream in late 2023.

Now it has been improved significantly by utilising AI frameworks to retroactively apply Komis.

And forked by me, toni20k5267, to have Shadow The Hedgehog :333

<h2> The image 23.png's artits is [u/ConferenceMean8503](https://www.reddit.com/user/ConferenceMean8503/) on Reddit, so a big shoutout to them. The rest of the artists of images in this extension is unknown to me, because I was not able to find the original image/post, or it's Sega. </h2>
